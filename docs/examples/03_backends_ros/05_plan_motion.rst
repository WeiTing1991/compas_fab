Plan motion

.. note::

    The following examples use the `ROS <https://www.ros.org/>`_ backend
    and the MoveI! planner for UR5 robots. Before running them, please
    make sure you have the :ref:`ROS backend <ros_backend>` correctly
    configured and the :ref:`UR5 Demo <ros_bundles_list>` started.

There are 2 function that allow to plan a robotic movement without collisions:
:class:`~compas_fab.robots.plan_cartesian_motion` and
:class:`~compas_fab.robots.plan_motion`.

.. More coming soon ...

Plan cartesian motion
=====================

Plan motion
===========

In contrast to the cartesian path, the :class:`~compas_fab.robots.plan_motion`
allows to describe the goal with constraints rather than defined frames.
